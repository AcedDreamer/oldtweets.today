# Contributing Guidelines

- If you're making a change to the UI, please include "Before" and "After" screenshots in your pull request. Mobile and desktop should both be included if the change affects both views.

- Your PR should have a description, where you explain what the change is and why it should be accepted. For major changes, it's recommended to open an issue first, so it can be discussed and vetted.
